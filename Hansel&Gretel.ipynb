      "To determine the probability that the last digit of the product of four numbers will be 1, 3, 5, or 9, we first need to examine the last digits of numbers and their properties when multiplied.\n",

      "The last digits of integers can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The last digit of a product depends on the last digits of the numbers being multiplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last digits that yield a product ending in 1, 3, 5, or 9 are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A product ends in **1** if the last digits are combinations of (1, 3, 7, 9) that multiply to give 1 mod 10.\n",
      "- A product ends in **3** has similar criteria involving (1, 3, 7, 9).\n",
      "- A product ends in **5** requires at least one number to end in 5.\n",
      "- A product ends in **9** also involves (1, 3, 7, 9) combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, notice that if any of the last digits of the four selected numbers is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, the product cannot end in 1, 3, 5, or 9. Therefore, we only consider the selection of last digits limited to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last digit options that can lead to a product resulting in 1, 3, 5, or 9 are 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Here’s the breakdown:\n",
      "- If you select any of these digits, then combinations of last digits from these numbers would need to be calculated.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Overall, the total count of last digit options is 10 (0 through 9). The digits that can lead to a product that last digit is either 1, 3, 5, or 9 exclude the even digits and the digit 5 does not help in getting a result of 1, 3, 5, or 9 without being combined with appropriate digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the calculation of probability:\n",
      "- Favorable outcomes (last digit = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9): 5 outcomes (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)\n",
      "- Total possible outcomes: 10 (0 through 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, when selecting 4 digits randomly and calculating the probability of getting at least one last digit to produce a favorable outcome leading to 1, 3, 5, or 9 becomes complex as it deals with outcomes of inclusive and exclusive of zero definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, after evaluating robustness against outcomes and considering the cases, the probability simplifies under mutual combinability distributions.\n",

    "## Facts:\n",
    "Hi, \n",
    "\n",
    "This is Hansel and Gretel Chen, not from the story lol, we are real people. We live with our father and step-mom. Our hobbies are camping and hiking, we love life in the woods and our favorite food is candy and pie. Our father is a really nice guy, his favourite hobby is wood cutting; we can't speak much about our step-mom we're still getting to know her. We like living here in manhattan, there is so much good food around. \n",
    "\n",
    "## User_Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time, nestled within the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan, there lived two outgoing siblings, Hansel and Gretel Chen. Their father, a renowned Broadway set designer, possessed an unparalleled talent for crafting majestic wooden structures. Manhattan was a far cry from an enchanted forest, but their apartment was often filled with the smell of fresh timber wood carvings, thanks to their father's passion. Despite their urban setting, the Chens had a profound love for the wilderness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hansel and Gretel had recently adjusted to having a new family member—their step-mom, Magda. Magda claimed she was a descendant of Amatarasu, the Japanese sun goddess, rumored to have a mystical ability to bake pies that could light up an entire room with warmth. As such, she had a distinctive way of bringing a special glow to any pie she baked.\n",
    "\n",
    "One summer, the Chen family decided to leave the bustling streets of New York behind for a much-anticipated camping trip to the pristine wilderness of Alaska. The moment they set foot in the woods, Hansel and Gretel's spirits soared. The sibling adventurers were armed with just a compass, a pack full of candy, and a mysterious pie from Magda that had a peculiar, golden hue. It was said that eating the pie under an Alaskan twilight could communicate with the ancient spirits of the land.\n",
    "\n",
    "As day turned to night, the forest whispered secrets in the breeze, and the stars danced to melodies unheard by human ears. Hansel and Gretel, fueled by courage and a touch of Magda’s magical pie, discovered new, uncharted paths through dense woods and shadowy clearings. The peculiar pie's aroma seemed to guide them deeper, promising tales of enchanted creatures and ancient legends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout their expedition, the siblings marveled at the wild beauty around them. They listened to the harmonies of howling wolves, and encountered a mystical raven who—according to local myth—had the power to alter weather with the flap of its wings.\n",
    "\n",
    "But their greatest discovery was an age-old cabin, rumoured to be built by the first Inuit settlers during a total solar eclipse. Here, Hansel and Gretel felt the warmth of family even in the middle of a chilly Alaskan night, thanks to a mysterious fire that burned eternal within the cabin, said to be ignited by the first sunrise Amatarasu herself bestowed upon Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hansel and Gretel's adventure in Alaska remained their most cherished memory, one they would recount with wonder, always wondering if it was the pie, the land, or a little bit of both that allowed magic into their lives during those enchanted forest nights."

Their mother had died one frosty day, so their father had married a new wife who was NOT as sweet as she seemed. In fact, she was as bad as a rotten apple. \\\"Your children eat too much,\\\" she grumbled one day to her husband, as Hansel and Gretel shared a single slice of stale bread. \\\"You must lose them in the wood and let the wild creatures care for them.\\\"\\\n",
    "\\n\\\n",
    "Their father was shocked. \\\"If I do that, the wolves will eat them,\\\" he protested. \\\"And if you don\\'t, we will all die of hunger,\\\" snapped the nasty stepmother. \\\"Take them away tonight.\\\" As soon as the first star shone, the children\\'s father led them along tangled pathways to a crooked tree. \\\"My dears,\\\" he groaned, \\\"wait here while I search for firewood.\\\" Then away he stumbled, back to his damp little cottage and his cruel wife. Quite soon, wolves began to howl and the children shivered. \\\"We have walked too far,\\\" sighed Gretel. \\\"Our father is lost, and so are we.\\\" \\\"Cheer up, little sister,\\\" said Hansel with a smile. \\\"I heard our Stepmother\\'s horrid plan, so I have marked every twist of the path with a pure white pebble.\\\" And there in the starlight Gretel saw a line of shining stones!\\\n",
    "\\n\\\n",
    "The children followed the white trail, and by sunrise they were safely home – but their stepmother\\'s smile was as cold as winter rain. \\\"Husband,\\\" she hissed. \\\"See how your two pests torment me. Tonight you must lose them forever.\\\" She gave each child a morsel of stale bread, and when their father led them through Long Lost Wood they followed him sadly. After many miles, he mopped his eyes and said, \\\"Wait here, my dears, while I search for ripe blackberries.\\\"\\\n",
    "\\n\\\n",
    "They knew he would never come back, but when the wolves howled, Hansel smiled and said, \\\"Cheer up, little sister. This time I have scattered a trail of small white breadcrumbs.\\\" Alas! There was no trail to be seen – hungry birds had stolen EVERY crumb. So the two children slept on a bed of brown leaves, and in their dreams they saw a white dove who circled above them, calling: \\\"Follow me! Follow me!\\\" \\\n",
    "\\n\\\n",
    "When they woke in the misty morning, there was the white dove fluttering away! \\\"Let\\'s follow her,\\\" said Hansel. \\\"Things can\\'t get any worse.\\\" Almost at once, the children saw a wonderful cottage made from gingerbread and sweeties. Their mouths watered, and soon they were nibbling delicious chunks of wall and windowsill. Suddenly, a sugar-sweet voice said, \\\"Come in my dears and warm yourselves.\\\" An old lady stood by the door, and the children forgot to be frightened. In they skipped, and BANG went the door. They were trapped inside a witch\\'s house!\\\n",
    "\\n\\\n",
    "Now her voice became as hard as a seaside rock. \\\"Got you!\\\" she cackled, locking Hansel inside an iron cage. \\\"Boy, you will grow plump and juicy. Girl, you will be my slave.\\\" Poor Hansel. The witch fattened him up until he was as round as a gobstopper. Poor Gretel. She ate nothing but scraps from the cat\\'s saucer. At last the witch shrieked, \\\"Girl! Build up the fire. I want Boy Pie for my tea.\\\"I\\'m very sorry,\\\" said Gretel politely, \\\"but I have never cooked a Boy Pie before. Do you think the\\\n",

    "\\n\\\n",
    "The witch stamped her foot and peered into the oven. \\\"It\\'s HOT, HOT, HOT!\\\" she screamed, and no wonder… Gretel had pushed her inside and slammed the door! In moments, Hansel was free. The two children grabbed the witch\\'s treasure and raced outside, to find the white dove waiting for them. Of course, she led them home by the shortest way, and when their father saw them, his smile was as warm as the summer sun. (Astonishingly, Hansel and Gretel\\'s horrible stepmother had vanished that very day – while all that remained of the wicked witch was one smoky gingerbread biscuit.)\\\n",

      "Title: Hansel and Gretel Chen's Arctic Adventure\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a crisp autumn morning, Hansel and Gretel Chen, two adventurous siblings and passionate campers, set their sights on the wild, untouched woods of Alaska. Leaving their bustling New York City home behind, they flew with their father and new stepmother to the land of endless forests, hoping to indulge in their shared love of hiking and camping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their father, a rugged man in spirit, always carried a trusty axe to satiate his enthusiasm for woodcutting, a hobby which often led to hours of bonding with Hansel. Their stepmom, however, remained a mystery wrapped in silence. Her presence was often like a shadow, lingering but not intrusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, amidst the tall, snow-draped trees, Hansel and Gretel ventured deep into the forest, bundled in their warmest clothes. They started by leaving a trail of candy wrappers (their favorite treat) to ensure they could find their way back. Although the candy was fleeting pleasure, the scents of the forest seemed to call them further.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rustling leaves whispered stories of wilderness adventures, coaxing the children further than they had ever dared to wander. The friendly woodland creatures they encountered along the way seemed to assure them of welcome. But as the sun dipped below the horizon, their trail had vanished into the snow, and a pang of worry struck them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeking refuge, the siblings stumbled upon a curious cabin nestled in a clearing. Its walls appeared festooned with dulcet candy and fruit pies—a sugary haven that tempted them despite its ominous aura. Too hungry and tired to resist, Hansel and Gretel cautiously knocked on the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "To their surprise, the cabin was not empty. A kind witch, Aurora, lived inside, eager to welcome them with warm smiles and even warmer pies. Aurora claimed she had been expecting them and knew of their affinity for such treats. Unbeknownst to them, her magical ability was not to deceive but to guide lost souls back to safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "When morning light spilled across the sky, Aurora gave the children a map to guide them home. With grateful hearts and a newfound courage, Hansel and Gretel retraced their steps, swearing to never underestimate the Alaskan wilds, or the kindness hidden in unexpected corners of the woods again.\n",
      "\n",
