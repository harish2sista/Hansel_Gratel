      "To determine the probability that the last digit of the product of four numbers will be 1, 3, 5, or 9, we first need to examine the last digits of numbers and their properties when multiplied.\n",

      "The last digits of integers can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The last digit of a product depends on the last digits of the numbers being multiplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last digits that yield a product ending in 1, 3, 5, or 9 are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A product ends in **1** if the last digits are combinations of (1, 3, 7, 9) that multiply to give 1 mod 10.\n",
      "- A product ends in **3** has similar criteria involving (1, 3, 7, 9).\n",
      "- A product ends in **5** requires at least one number to end in 5.\n",
      "- A product ends in **9** also involves (1, 3, 7, 9) combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, notice that if any of the last digits of the four selected numbers is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, the product cannot end in 1, 3, 5, or 9. Therefore, we only consider the selection of last digits limited to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last digit options that can lead to a product resulting in 1, 3, 5, or 9 are 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Here’s the breakdown:\n",
      "- If you select any of these digits, then combinations of last digits from these numbers would need to be calculated.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Overall, the total count of last digit options is 10 (0 through 9). The digits that can lead to a product that last digit is either 1, 3, 5, or 9 exclude the even digits and the digit 5 does not help in getting a result of 1, 3, 5, or 9 without being combined with appropriate digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the calculation of probability:\n",
      "- Favorable outcomes (last digit = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9): 5 outcomes (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)\n",
      "- Total possible outcomes: 10 (0 through 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, when selecting 4 digits randomly and calculating the probability of getting at least one last digit to produce a favorable outcome leading to 1, 3, 5, or 9 becomes complex as it deals with outcomes of inclusive and exclusive of zero definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, after evaluating robustness against outcomes and considering the cases, the probability simplifies under mutual combinability distributions.\n",

    "This is Hansel and Gretel Chen, not from the story lol, we are real people. We live with our father and step-mom. Our hobbies are camping and hiking, we love life in the woods and our favorite food is candy and pie. Our father is a really nice guy, his favourite hobby is wood cutting; we can't speak much about our step-mom we're still getting to know her. We like living here in manhattan, there is so much good food around. \n",

    "Once upon a time, nestled deep in the heart of the Alaskan woods camping are the adventurous siblings, Hansel and Gretel Chen. Now, you might think that growing up surrounded by towering trees and crisp, fresh air would be a challenge, but for these two, the forest was nothing short of magical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hansel and Gretel, whose origin story speaks of bustling city lights and concrete jungles, found solace in the embrace of nature early on. Their father, a man with a deeply embedded love for the forest, had always been drawn to the tranquility it offered. An expert woodcutter by trade, he instilled in his children the beauty and serenity of living harmoniously with their wooded surroundings. His passion for chopping wood was not just a hobby but a way of life that beautifully complemented their rustic existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The siblings' love for candy and pie was legendary throughout the forest, where they often shared sweet morsels with their woodland friends. Stories spread far and wide of their culinary skills, matched only by their mastery of camping and hiking. Exploring the vast Alaskan forests became second nature to them, navigating through trails known only to the most seasoned woodland creatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming from Manhattan—a stark contrast from the wilderness they grew to adore—the Chens quickly fell in love with the life in the Alaskan woods, a perfect playground for their adventurous spirits. Hansel and Gretel's step-mom, whom they were still getting to know, was a mysterious figure, elusive yet oddly intriguing, hinting at tales of city life with a hint of mystery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alaska, with its vast expanses and breath-taking landscapes, became more than just a backdrop; it was their haven. Every day was an adventure, an opportunity to discover a new path, a new chapter in their life story, hidden among the towering trees. In this enchanting woodland realm, Hansel and Gretel Chen had truly found their place, living the life they had only dreamed of during their frequent camping trips northward from their previous city dwelling."
